## Installation
- This project will requires the use of:
- node.js
- inquirer npm (for question prompts)
- fs npm (for writing the README files within a folder)

## Usage
Once everything is installed, open a cli tool (like git bash for windows or terminal for mac). Type `node ./src/index.js`, and the prompts should begin in the command line.  Once all prompts are answered, a README file should generate in the sub-directory folder named as `tmp`.  There you have it, a newly generated readme.
